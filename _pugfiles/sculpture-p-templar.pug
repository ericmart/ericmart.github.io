          p.workDescription
            | Language is a powerful tool in art, and in the Templar piece, the coded
            | nature of the title gives weight to the formal and material qualities of the work itself.
            | The basic building materials chosen are materials man has used throughout history to build
            | nations, forms, and objects that still dominate our way of living. In addition are found materials,
            | like a log from the Santa Monica mountains which holds an acrylic platform, which adorns a drop of the artist's blood.
