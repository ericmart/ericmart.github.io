        | Design What? is a publication that was conceived as part of a thesis project
        br
        | demonstrating a focused approach to information, aesthetics and audience.
        br
        | The goal of this project was to create a Graphic Design instruction manual
        br
        | that both an experienced designer, or a curious patron could understand
        br
        | easily in addition to learn valuable information and implementation. There
        br
        | were specific requirements in the typographic and stylization which the
        br
        | client requested that as the solo designer found intriguing, worthwhile, and challenging.
      p.smaller
        | Publication is composed of four-color process prints that are staple bound.

        | Dimensions: 4.5" x 6.5"
